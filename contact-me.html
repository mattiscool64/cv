      <!-- On the contact me section we want to give people the option to respond. We do this by inputting the
      form class tag, followed by label (name of location they are to enter data in) and this followed by
      input type which would be where they enter text. We also have to provide the abilit for them to submit
      the information they input. This is done with input type "submit" followed by deleting the value attribute.
      Other attribute functions for reference include things like color picker or even checkbox. Can also add
      something like a password box.-->

      <label>Your Name:</label>
      <input type="text" name="" value="">

      Do you want to sign up to the email list?

    <h2>Now we do a more propper form</h2>
    <!--textarea is used to creat a text box. We also need to input "mailto:" with the email the information is to
    be mailed to when the submit button is used In order for that to be clear we need to delete "class" from our form.
    tag as well as add the atribute enctype (encoding type) and enter "text/plain" so that no information gets mixed up.
    and this simply specifies that our website is encoded in utf-8. We also need to add a value to each of the name
    attributes because that is going to identify the data within (video 26 ~5:00min)-->
